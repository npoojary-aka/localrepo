# My Local Repo

This repository contains a simple HTML project.

## Project Structure:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the webpage.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the webpage.

## Recent Revisions:
- **HTML Overhaul**: `index.html` has been significantly updated to include a proper HTML structure (header, main, footer) and semantic content organization. The previous paragraph-based content is now presented as a list within the main section.
- **CSS Styling Added**: A new `style.css` file was created and linked to `index.html`. This file provides a clean, modern look and feel to the webpage, including styling for the body, header, main content, list items, and footer.

This README has been updated to reflect these changes.
